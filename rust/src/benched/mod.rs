//! # Benchmark Lifecycle Management
//!
//! This module defines the [`Benched`] trait that provides setup/teardown lifecycle
//! for benchmark iterations. Both PostgreSQL and Doublets storage backends implement
//! this trait to enable fair benchmarking.
//!
//! ## Module Structure
//!
//! The implementations are split into separate files for clear comparison:
//!
//! - **[`doublets_benched`]** - Doublets storage backend implementations
//! - **[`psql_benched`]** - PostgreSQL storage backend implementations

mod doublets_benched;

/// Provides the setup/teardown lifecycle for benchmark iterations:
/// - [`Benched::setup`] - Initialize the storage backend
/// - [`Benched::fork`] - Create an isolated environment for a single iteration
/// - [`Benched::unfork`] - Clean up after the iteration
